module Spontaneous::Model::Action
  # Designed to be run after any schema modifications that delete types or boxes
  # this action deletes all instances with invalid type ids and then cleans
  # up the remaining content by testing the visibility path of each remaining instance
  # and deletes any that are 'orphaned' i.e. they have a hole in their ancestry.
  #
  # This would normally be managed by the recursive destroy but when we're dealing
  # with content that has no matching schema type it's hard to instantiate them & hence
  # hard to invoke a destroy (and we resort to db level deletes)
  #
  # This is an argument for moving hierarcy maintenance into db level triggers
  # rather than keeping them at the ORM level.
